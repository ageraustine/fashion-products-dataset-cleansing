Cleaning and preprocessing Kaggle fashion products dataset 

# Libraries used
The fashion industry is growing at a very supersonic speed with billions of bytes of data being generated every day
The tech industry is therefore tasked with labeling, cleaning and preprocessing these data which is very important in building predictive models.

The fashion products dataset from kaggle is therefore very significant for building machine learning models such as colour recognition model, apparel classification model and many more models.
A proper cleaning of this dataset will therefore ensure that we have models with good generalization capability
